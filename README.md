# BMOS (Black Mesa Operating System)
It used to compile... until docker decided no. Any help on this would be VERY appreciated.

So this is supposed to be a project attempting to see what an Operating System that the fictional company, Black Mesa, from the Half-Life series would use. This idea came to fruition because I was playing Black Mesa and on the computers I saw BMOS multiple times.

Yes, I did steal code from an older project that I made that I used from a tutorial.

It does boot but I can't find any motivation to add more due to it not being able to find c++ libs and stuff, probably because the build env is running debian 9 via docker on a windows 11 home pc.

I hope you find more luck than me attempting to add more.
